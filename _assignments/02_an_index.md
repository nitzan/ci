*Due Week 15, midterm check-in week 7*
 
Build an index page for yourself using the following structure. 

~~~
| index.html 
|
| studio/
|--- week_01.html
|--- week_02.html
|--- etc...
|
| lab/
|--- 01_something-beautiful.html
|--- etc...
~~~

This page will be an archive for all of your course work over the semester. The index should be clearly structured, and reflect your design sensibility.
