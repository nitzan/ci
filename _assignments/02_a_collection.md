## Build a collection of media objects with a theme of your choosing. Create an interface to navigate through and create groups within your archive. What are the different ways you may organize the content? How may the structure of your collection reflect or alter the meaning communicated?



## Requirements

Your collection should include at least 20 media objects. These objects may consist of original or sourced content. Sourced content must be attributed accordingly. Your collection must contain a minimum of four schema for organizing content, with each schema containing multiple navigation methods.  

*ex: Within a collection of Tools, you may choose to group the collection by their handles (schema). Within that schema you may group the collection of by tools with the following methods, view red handles, view blue handles, view orange handles, etc...*



## Part 1: Research  

*Due Tuesday, Feb 7*

Collect at least 5 examples of media objects that represent potential items for your colleciton. Make a list of the characteristics that define objects within the collection. Build a brief 1920 x 1080 slide presentation containing a proposal outlining your direction for the project. Your presentation should contain the following:

* A succint statement describing the subject matter of your choosing, and what theme(s) you intend to explore.
* The examples of media objects representing potential items for your colleciton.
* Potential methods in which you may organize the content.




## Part 2: Design

*Due Tuesday, Feb 14*

Collect the rest of the media for your website. Create 3 proposals for a website for your archive. You should have a minumum of four schema for organizing, navigating, grouping, filtering, or sorting that you would like to focus on.  

After meeting with the class and recieving feedback, create 3 more directions that focus on your chosen direction. Continue to refine the site structure, navigation and content by exploring alternative options.




## Considerations

Think about how design of the site can support the communication of an ideal. Is your position unique? Is it interesting? Is the navigation immediately appararent, utilitarian?  Is it expressive? Is it beautiful?
