Using object we made in class, and event listeners, create your own typewriter that accounts for all 26 letters of the alphabet (at least).

What we did is one example of form that could be made using the keydown interaction method. What are some other ways you can use this interaction method to create a unique piece?

*Week 11: Concept Due*  
By next week you should have a conceptual draft of your typewriter. This can take the form of a code sketch, static design, writing, etc.

*Week 12: Work Session*

*Due Week 13: Final Typewriter Due*
